#Paint Splat Game
Unity Version 2020.3.20f1


###Overview:

In this project, the multi-player game’s goal is to get the most paint splats on a shared
paint board within a designated time period. There should a central Paint Board, onto
which multiple, mobile players throw paint. After an agreed period of time, the game
stops, and the player with the most paint “hits” wins!
